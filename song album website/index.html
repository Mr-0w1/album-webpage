                        May 1985, by Vertigo Records internationally and Warner Bros. Records in the United States. It
                        was the first album in history to sell over one million copies in CD format. The album was
                        produced by bandleader Mark Knopfler and by Neil Dorfsman, who had engineered Dire Straits' 1982
                        album Love over Gold and Knopfler's 1983 soundtrack album Local Hero. Brothers in Arms spent a
                        total of 14 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart (including ten
                        consecutive weeks between 18 January and 22 March 1986), nine weeks at number one on the
                        Billboard 200 in the United States and 34 weeks at number one on the Australian Albums Chart. It
                        was the first album to be certified ten-times platinum in the UK and is the eighth-best-selling
                        album in UK chart history. It is certified nine-times platinum in the United States by the
                        Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is one of the world's best-selling albums,
                        having sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. To promote the album, Dire Straits embarked
                        on the Brothers in Arms Tour, which ran from 1985 to 1986. The album won a Grammy Award in 1986
                        for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards; the
                        20th Anniversary reissue won another Grammy in 2006 for Best Surround Sound Album. In 2020,
                        Rolling Stone magazine ranked Brothers in Arms number 418 on its list of the "500 Greatest
                        Albums of All Time". Q magazine ranked it number 51 on its list of the "100 Greatest British
                        Albums Ever". In 2025, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the album’s original release, the
                        album was re-released in several formats, including a five LP box set and triple CD. This box
                        set included the full studio album as well as a previously unreleased full-length live concert
                        from the band’s Municipal Auditorium, San Antonio show during the world tour.

                        Alchemy: Dire Straits Live is the first live album by the British rock band Dire Straits,
                        released on 16 March 1984[3] by Vertigo Records internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in
                        the United States. Recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on 22–23 July 1983, the double
                        album features songs from the band's first four albums (Dire Straits, Communiqué, Making Movies
                        and Love Over Gold), the ExtendedancEPlay EP and Mark Knopfler's Local Hero soundtrack. Many of
                        the songs have reworked arrangements and extended instrumental segments. The album cover is
                        taken from a painting by Brett Whiteley. Alchemy: Dire Straits Live was remastered and reissued
                        with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the United
                        States and was remastered and re-released in the USA on 8 May 2001. In November 2023, Alchemy
                        was included in the box set anthology, Live 1978-1992.
